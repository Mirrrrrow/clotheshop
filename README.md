# Clotheshop

## ðŸ“‹ Description
This script actually makes clothes available for purchase. Players won't be able to access every piece of clothing without buying it first. You can configure shops, wardrobes and prices that vary.

## ðŸ¥‡ Installation
The following resources are required to use this script: **es_extended**, **oxmysql**, **ox_lib**. We also provide support for **ox_target**. Some 'core' functions and settings can be changed in the config.lua file, for more specific changes check the data folder.

## ðŸ“š Documentation / Support
If you need help with something, just add me on discord (mirow), maybe I will make a documentation page at some point. For bugs please open a GitHub issue.

## ðŸ’¾ Download
